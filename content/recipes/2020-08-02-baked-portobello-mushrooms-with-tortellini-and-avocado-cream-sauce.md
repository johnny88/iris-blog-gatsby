instructions:
  - To begin, preheat the oven to 450F. To make this dreamy rainy day comfort
    food, you will first need to marinate the mushrooms. Use a towel to gently
    rub the mushrooms to help remove any dirt and take off the stems. Take the
    olive oil, seedy mustard, balsamic and salt and pepper and combine in a
    bowl. Once combined, pour over the mushrooms, make sure all the mushrooms
    are coated and let this mixture sit in the fridge for at least 20 mins (up
    to 3 hours).
  - While that is marinating, go ahead and slice the red pepper right down the
    middle. Discard of the seeds and stem, and place it face up on a greased
    baking sheet. Drizzle the pepper with some olive oil and some salt and
    pepper. Never be afraid of "too much pepper" and a little oops for good
    measure. Flip the peppers face down and drizzle with a little more olive
    oil, get that healthy fat for the heart!! Once the oven is ready, pop this
    in and cook for 20 mins or until tender.
  - While this is roasting away, chop up the onion and garlic and set aside.
    Dont let the emotional outpour from chopping the onion let you forget to
    remove those peppers from the oven! Let cool.
  - " Change the oven temperature to 400F and lets get started on those
    mushrooms! Place the marinated mushrooms in a greased pan bottom of the
    mushroom facing up and bake for 15 mins. Flip the mushrooms facing up and
    cook for another 15 mins, giving it a nice golden colour. I personally set a
    timer for this, as I know I will forget and be eating burned mushrooms for
    dinner instead."
  - While this is baking, start a pot of water to boil the pasta! Instead of
    watching water boil, which can feel like forever, go ahead and return to
    those tasty roasted red peppers. They should be easier to handle with your
    hands now. You will have to peel off the outer skin from the peppers. this
    should be easier and less painful than a bandaid. Once peeled, cut the
    peppers into long strips and then cut in half again. Place to the side. Now
    for the sauce.
  - Place all ingredients into a blender or food processor and blend until a
    smooth creamy texture. Add extra salt, pepper and oil to taste. Set aside.
    On another burner, start a deep frying pan on at medium heat with some
    coconut oil. Once heated, add the onions and cook for 5 mins, until
    translucent. After, add the minced garlic, basil, chili flakes, thyme and
    sliced kale to the pan. Continue to cook until Kale is tender.
  - While this is cooking, the water should be boiled. Add Pasta and cook as per
    the packaging instructions. Once the mushrooms are cooked take them out of
    the oven to cool a bit. Cut the mushrooms into long strips and place it back
    in the off oven to stay warm.
  - The Pasta should be cooked now along with the kale - PERFECT. lets start
    making a meal out of this! Take the roasted red peppers and pasta and add it
    to the kale mixture - make the heat on this low just to keep warm. Stir it
    all together so everything is coated nicely. Add the sauce and continue to
    stir to coat the entire dish. Now its time to eat. Place the pasta into a
    dish and top with the mushrooms and if you are like me, throw on some extra
    nutritional yeast and chili and voila! Enjoy every last bite.

This is one of my favourite lazy rainy day comfort meals. This can easily be made non vegan with your favourite brand of Tortellini, some chopped up cured meats or an added cheese of your choice! 

Sidenote about the spice quanities. ANY time I am following a recipe, I never think there is enough spice, like who is just using a half a teaspoon of basil - WHO?? Not me that is for sure. I end up adding more spice than my partners palate can deal with, but thats just me. So if you find yourself in the process of cooking this meal and you want alter the amounts of the spices to your tasting pleasure, then go nuts! You are the one having to eat it after all. 

I hope you enjoy as much as I do :)
