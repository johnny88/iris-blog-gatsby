want to work out, but dont want the hassle of fixing your hair all over again?  I know the struggle. The debate plagues so many of us. We want to be living our best lives and looking fit and healthy, but do i REALLY want to wash and style my hair after taking away ten years from my life? Unless you have nothing better to do, the answer is a big fat NO.  

Many friends have asked how I look so amazing after a workout. And yes I am very much working out, getting a sweat in, while working out. My hair is far from perfect, but I have learned many ways to manage it to be as effortless as possible. I am not trying to spend hours and hours getting ready for anything so I promise this will be painless. 



the answer is more simple than you would imagine. Preparation, preparation, PREPARATION. If you just tie your hair in a bun or pony tail and just go about your business, you will be displeased with the end result of your hair. Sorry but it is true and someone had to say it.  

My biggest piece of advise is to tie your hair into a braid. nothing fancy, just a simple twist of the wrists and boom boom bam. its tied back. Now if you are like me, you will have some hairs creeping out towards your face and the tail of the braid is resting on your neck and back. the next step is to pull the hair back from the face, as if its not in a braid at all, twist the hair into a bun style and hold it together with a scrunchie. If you do not have a scrunchie as this state of the game, what are you even doing with your life. go get one. Now if you are still like, Eva, girl, my hair is sweaty to the next degree at my hairline. No worries, we all get our sweat on in different ways. Its time to start investing in a sweatband. you heard me. get that sweatband style going. Life changing - I promise. another thing i utilize for this is what i like to call a whitney. you ever watch whitney perform, she always always got a rag near by to wipe the sweat. she does not let a little sweat get in the way of her being fierce. Wipe away the sweat periodically in your workout, and wipe away the worry of nasty looking hair.
